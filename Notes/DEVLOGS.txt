Finished implementing and testing the DynamicBicycleModel against the Unity counterpart, very similar but there are not the exact same; this may be due to the way C/C++ works; Unity with its own overhead and timing loops could be the cause.

Finished implementing and testing the PathLogic, it's able to reliably generate tracks and checkpoints; visually checked, the high density of checkpoints is never a bad thing; the way the Racing algorithm controller syncs everything together may be the problem.

Racing algorithm testing done by Goat Joshua
    Fixed compiler warnings
    Fixed reaction time steering logic

Main Controller actually works with proper graphics
NOTE: For the manual control to work you have to be on active on the terminal window not the SDL window

    Fixed manual controller (Removed a controller that just drives the car in a circle)
    Cone Collision detection broken
    Lap detection broken
    

- Fixed Cone Collision Detection
- Crude Lap Completion Detection (Distance based)
- CODEX broke everything
