Finished implementing and testing the DynamicBicycleModel against the Unity counterpart, very similar but there are not the exact same; this may be due to the way C/C++ works; Unity with its own overhead and timing loops could be the cause.

Finished implementing and testing the PathLogic, it's able to reliably generate tracks and checkpoints; visually checked, the high density of checkpoints is never a bad thing; the way the Racing algorithm controller syncs everything together may be the problem.
