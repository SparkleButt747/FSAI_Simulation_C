BUGS AND NOTES SIMULATION SUB SYSTEM:
    -Sometimes the car manages to take a wide line completely missing the checkpoint 
    that is the middle of the track, we need to change the collision of the checkpoint from a 
    circle to a straight line across the track (bridge) so no matter what line it takes it always hits the checkpoint

    -Sometimes the car manages to go through the gap between the cones, bridges need to setup connecting cones so we have a barrier of
    sorts to prevent the car leaving the track, (considering this as a collision)

    -I think the car is supposed to go anti-clockwise around the track, because from the track generator (as per EUFS)
    when we get the left cones and right cones and color them as per rules (i.e left -> blue, right -> yellow), and force the
    car to go clockwise, the blue cones end up being on the right and yellow on left. so currently I have just swapped the
    colors but we need to swap them back around and make sure the car goes anti clockwise to keep everything consistent...

    -When the controller gets aggressive into braking or under throttle, and the car slips/slides , since relaxing
    dynamics are not implemented to allow drifting, the car model breaks down and everything explodes... something to implemented
    later down the line

    -The car controller needs interpolation -> more checkpoints then the available ones (no. of checkpoint = 
    max(leftcones, rightcones)) to allow smoother driving. Ends up crashing more often than not...

    -The collision boxes are greatly simplified in this simulation, everything is either a square or a circle; so Vision 
    (which is in charge of collision detection) cannot reliably use the simulation as a backbone to ground truth. actual cone
    models and cars models need to be made/downloaded from the official repo or made in blender for better realism (this also
    helps with rendering more realistic lighting effects)...
