Finished implementing and testing the DynamicBicycleModel against the Unity counterpart, very similar but there are not the exact same; this may be due to the way C/C++ works; Unity with its own overhead and timing loops could be the cause.

Finished implementing and testing the PathLogic, it's able to reliably generate tracks and checkpoints; visually checked, the high density of checkpoints is never a bad thing; the way the Racing algorithm controller syncs everything together may be the problem.

Racing algorithm testing done by Goat Joshua
    Fixed compiler warnings
    Fixed reaction time steering logic

Main Controller actually works with proper graphics
NOTE: For the manual control to work you have to be on active on the terminal window not the SDL window

    Fixed manual controller (Removed a controller that just drives the car in a circle)
    Cone Collision detection broken
    Lap detection broken
    

- Fixed Cone Collision Detection
- Crude Lap Completion Detection (Distance based)

TODO:
    -Write Graphics for Telemetry
    -Brainstorm Vision Pipeline Integration
    -Work On Writing A Grid Search To Optimize Racing Algorithm
    
BUGS:
    -Sometimes the car manages to take a wide line completely missing the checkpoint 
    that is the middle of the track, we need to change the collision box of the checkpoint from a 
    circle to a straight line across the track so no matter what line it takes it always hits the checkpoint


---Vision---
* Object detection and stereo triangulation have been moved into ConeDetector and StereoTriangulation concrete classes respectively
* VisionNode will be the main class for the vision pipeline. Documentation pending on how to access
* SimCamera deprecates the vision_test library. FrameBuffer taken verbatem from the vision_test/

TO-DO:
    - Connect feature matching and centroid recovery into the pipeline
    - Make the connections from vision to simulation to get the frames
    - Make the connection from vision to control to pass along key-points
    - Verify E2E constraint of 20ms
BUGS:
    - CMakeLists.txt needs to be updated to build the full system
