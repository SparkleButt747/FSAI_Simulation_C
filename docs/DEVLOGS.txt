BUGS AND NOTES SIMULATION SUB SYSTEM:
    -Sometimes the car manages to take a wide line completely missing the checkpoint
    that is the middle of the track, we need to change the collision of the checkpoint from a
    circle to a straight line across the track (bridge) so no matter what line it takes it always hits the checkpoint
    that is the middle of the track, we need to change the collision box of the checkpoint from a
    circle to a straight line across the track so no matter what line it takes it always hits the checkpoint

    -Sometimes the car manages to go through the gap between the cones, bridges need to setup connecting cones so we have a barrier of
    sorts to prevent the car leaving the track, (considering this as a collision)

    -I think the car is supposed to go anti-clockwise around the track, because from the track generator (as per EUFS)
    when we get the left cones and right cones and color them as per rules (i.e left -> blue, right -> yellow), and force the
    car to go clockwise, the blue cones end up being on the right and yellow on left. so currently I have just swapped the
    colors but we need to swap them back around and make sure the car goes anti clockwise to keep everything consistent...

    -When the controller gets aggressive into braking or under throttle, and the car slips/slides , since relaxing
    dynamics are not implemented to allow drifting, the car model breaks down and everything explodes... something to implemented
    later down the line

    -The car controller needs interpolation -> more checkpoints then the available ones (no. of checkpoint =
    max(leftcones, rightcones)) to allow smoother driving. Ends up crashing more often than not...

    -The collision boxes are greatly simplified in this simulation, everything is either a square or a circle; so Vision
    (which is in charge of collision detection) cannot reliably use the simulation as a backbone to ground truth. actual cone
    models and cars models need to be made/downloaded from the official repo or made in blender for better realism (this also
    helps with rendering more realistic lighting effects)...

---Vision---
* Object detection and stereo triangulation have been moved into ConeDetector and StereoTriangulation concrete classes respectively
* VisionNode will be the main class for the vision pipeline. Documentation pending on how to access
* SimCamera deprecates the vision_test library. FrameBuffer taken verbatem from the vision_test/

TO-DO:
    - Connect feature matching and centroid recovery into the pipeline
    - Make the connections from vision to simulation to get the frames
    - Make the connection from vision to control to pass along key-points
    - Verify E2E constraint of 20ms
BUGS:
    - CMakeLists.txt needs to be updated to build the full system
